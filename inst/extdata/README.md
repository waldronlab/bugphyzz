| Confidence_in_curation\*| How trustable is a source. |
| Evidence \*\* | The type of evidence supporting the annotations in the original source. Options: exp, igc, nas, tas. |
| full_source | The full name of the source. It could be a citation, a link to webpage or project, etc. |

**\* Confidence_in_curation**
- High.

- Low.

**\*\* Evidence**
- exp. Inferred from experiment.
- igc. Inferred from genomic context.
- nas. Non-traceable author statement.
- tas. Traceable author statement. 

## [attributes.tsv](./attributes.tsv)

Contains the description of the attribute values included in bugphyzz.

Columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| attribute | The name of the attribute. |
| validity | The type of the attribute, either 'logical' for categorical values or 'numeric' for ranges. |
| ontology | Mapping to an ontology term (if possible). |
| attribute_group | The group(s) where an attribute name could be found. |
| description | The meaning of the attribute described in the 'attribute' column. |

## [spreadsheet_custmolinks.tsv](./spreadsheet_customlinks.tsv)

Links for datasets in spreadsheets that are not in tidy format and need to be
converted to tidy format. These datasets are not imported through the 
physiologies function, so they need their own fucntion.

Columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| physiology | Name of the physiology or attribute group. |
| ontology | If applicably, mapping to an ontology term. |
| link | Link to the csv export. |
| functionname | The name of the function (unexported) in bugphyzz. |
| source_link |  Link to the source spreadsheet on Google Docs. |


## [spreadsheet_links.tsv](./spreadsheet_links.tsv)

Links for datasets in spreadsheets that are already in tidy format.
These datsets are imported with the physiologies function (no exported).

Columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| physiology | Name of the dataset. Equivalent to attribute group. |
| ontolgy | Mapping to an ontology term if applicable. |
| sig_type | The type of the signature. Either range for numeric or logical for categorical and binary values. |
| link | Link to the csv export. |
| source_link | Link to the source spreadsheet. |

## [curation_template.tsv](./curation_template.tsv)

Contains the formal description of the data model in the spreadsheets imported
by the physiologies funtion.

Columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| column_name | Name of the column in the spreadsheet. |
| requiredness | Whether the column needs to be present in all attributes (required) or not (optional). |
| required_column_order | Order of the column if required. |
| attribute_types | Types of the attributes. Not R classes. Import function behavior will change based on this values. |
| valid_values | A regular expression with the values that are accepted. Except for the column 'Attriubte' which is a function name ('.attributes'). |
| value_test | If 'string' the test of validity is based on the regular expresion. If '.attributes', it's based on the function .attriubtes (no exported). |
| column_class | One of the R classes for atomic vectors. |

## [thresholds.tsv](./thresholds.tsv)

Tresholds for converting numeric/range data to categorical.

Columns:

| Column name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Attribute_group | Physiology. Name of the spreadsheet. |
| Attribute | The actual attribute used. |
| lower | lower threshold. |
| uppwer | upper threshold. |
| unit | units used for numeric data. |
