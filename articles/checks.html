</h2>
<p>NCBI IDs are compared against the latest version of the NCBI ID
database available through <code>taxizedb</code>.</p>
<p>If an NCBI ID is <strong>outdated</strong> (some IDs are no longer in
use or are merged into another one), then a more recent NCBI ID and
taxon name are suggested based on the result of
<code><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/taxize/reference/classification.html" class="external-link">taxize::classification</a></code>. You should see “outdated” in the
comment column (below).</p>
<p>If no NCBI ID is suggested, it’s likely because the taxid doesn’t
exist. You should see “not found” in the comment column (below).</p>
<p>Note: taxize and taxizedb are not based on the same annotations. Both
former and updated annotations can be accessed through taxize. However,
this can take a long time since the client must make requests to the
NCBI API. Having an NCBI API key can help (it’s free once you created
your NCBI account). On the other hand, working with the taxizedb
functions is much faster. This is because the NCBI database is
downloaded first to the user’s machine. Only the most recent version of
the database is downloaded, that’s why only current annotations are
show. Roughly, taxize behaves like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi" class="external-link uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi</a>
while taxizedb behaves like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/" class="external-link uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/</a>.</p>
