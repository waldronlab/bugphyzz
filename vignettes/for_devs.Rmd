# Introduction

This vignette is intended as a guide for those interested in contributing
to the bugphyzz project.

# How is the data formatted in bugphyzz?

In bugphyzz, the data is stored and provided in tabular format. 
Each row represents a link between a taxon and an attribute annotation
(see description in main vignette). TODO: add link to the description of the
columns.

# Adding data

Data can be added in two main ways 1) curated spreadsheets, 2) importing and
parsing data with code (e.g., using and API).

Independently of the option choses, the data must be in the format established
in the [attributes.tsv]() file.

## Curated spreadsheets

1. Add a new curated spreadsheet to drive and publish to the web as a csv file.
If this data was parsed with code, store the script in 
[waldronlab/bugphyzzWrangling/scripts](). Otherwise, write a description in a
README.txt file.
2. Download the github repo [waldronlab/bugphyzz]().
3. Create and checkout a new branch with username and an identifier (e.g.,
sdgamboa/new-physiology). 
Command example: `git checkout -b sdgamboa/new-physiology`. 
4. Add the links of the published csv and the spreadsheet source to the
[links.csv]() file.
5. Run the [sysdata.R]() script to add full taxonomy, including parent ranks,
to each taxon with taxid.
6. Add and commit changes.
7. Create a pull request and ask for a review -->> name here who could be
those reviewers <<--.

The changes will be checked with the unit tests. Changes might be requested.
For example, adding values to the [attributes.tsv]() file if not present.

## Through and API

This is the ideal way for adding data, because it's eaiser to update. It's
also the most complicated way of contributing because it requires the
creation of new functions or modifying existing functions in bugphyzz.

1. Write code to parse and use the API.
2. Download the github repo [waldronlab/bugphyzz]().
3. Create and checkout a new branch with username and an identifier (e.g.,
sdgamboa/new-physiology). 
Command example: `git checkout -b sdgamboa/new-physiology`. 
4. Create functions for using the data from the API and integratint the
data into currenct bugphyzz physiologies (or add new physiologies).
5. Add and commit.
6. Create a pull request, asking for a review.
