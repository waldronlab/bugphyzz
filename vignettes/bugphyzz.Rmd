# Introduction

[bugphyzz](https://github.com/waldronlab/bugphyzzExports)
is an electronic database of standardized microbial annotations.
It facilitates the creation of microbial signatures based on shared attributes,
which are utilized for bug set enrichment analysis.

# Data schema

Annotations in bugphyzz represent the link between a taxon (Bacteria/Archaea)
and an attribute, as outlined in the data schema provided below.

</center>

**Taxon-related**

Taxonomic data in bugphyzz is standardized according to the NCBI taxonomy:

1. _NCBI ID_: An integer representing the NCBI taxonomy ID (taxid) associated
with a taxon.
2. _Rank_: A character string indicating the taxonomy rank,
including superkingdom, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species,
or strain.
3. _Taxon name_: A character string denoting the scientific name of the taxon.

**Attribute-related**

Attribute data is harmonized with a controlled vocabulary based on available
ontology terms. Details of attributes, ontology terms, and ontology libraries
can be found in the 'Attribute and sources' vignette.

4. _Attribute_: A character string describing the name of a trait that can be
observed or measured.
5. _Attribute type_: A character string indicating the data type:
    * numeric: Attributes with numeric values (e.g., growth temperature: 25°C).
    * binary: Attributes with boolean values (e.g., butyrate-producing: TRUE).
    * multistate-intersection: A set of related binary attributes (e.g., habitat).
    * multistate-union: Attributes with three or more values represented as
    character strings (e.g., aerophilicity: aerobic, anaerobic,
    or facultatively anaerobic).
6. _Attribute value_: The possible values that an attribute could take,
represented as character strings, booleans, or numbers.

**Attribute value-related**

Metadata associated with attribute values:

7. _Attribute source_: The source of the information.
8. _Evidence_: The type of evidence supporting an annotation, including:
    * EXP: Experiment
    * IGC: Inferred from genomic context
    * TAS: Traceable author statement
    * NAS: Non-traceable author statement
    * IBD: Inferred from biological aspect of descendant
    * ASR: Ancestral state reconstruction

9. _Support values_:
    * Frequency and Score: Confidence that a given taxon exhibits a trait
    based on the curator’s knowledge or results of ASR or IBD.
    * Validation: Score from the [10-fold cross-validation analysis](https://github.com/waldronlab/taxPProValidation).
    Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for discrete attributes and
    R-squared for numeric attributes. Default threshold value is 0.5 and above.
    * NSTI: Nearest sequence taxon index from [PICRUSt](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2676)
    or the [castor package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/castor/index.html).
    Relevant for numeric values only.

**Attribute source-related**

10. _Confidence in curation_: A character string indicating the confidence
value of a source based on three criteria: 1) presence of a source, 2) valid
references, and 3) peer-reviewed curation.
Valid options include high, medium, or low, corresponding to satisfaction of
three, two, or one of these criteria.

# Analysis and Stats

This vignette serves as an introduction to the basic functionalities of
bugphyzz. For a more in-depth analysis and detailed statistics
utilizing bugphyzz annotations, please visit:
https://github.com/waldronlab/bugphyzzAnalyses

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

## Devel version
BiocManager::install("waldronlab/bugphyzz")
```

# Import bugphyzz data

Load the bugphyzz package and additional packages for data manipulation:

```{r load package, message=FALSE}
library(bugphyzz)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
```

bugphyzz data is imported using the `importBugphyzz` function,
resulting in a list of tidy data frames. Each data frame corresponds to an
attribute or a group of related attributes. This is particularly evident in
the case of the multistate-union type described in the data schema above,
where related attributes are grouped together in a single data frame. Available
attribute names can be inspected with the `names` function:

```{r import data, message=FALSE}
bp <- importBugphyzz()
names(bp)
```

Let's take a glimpse at one of the data frames:

```{r a glimpse}
glimpse(bp$aerophilicity, width = 50)
```

Compare the column names with the data schema described above.

# Create microbial signatures

bugphyzz's primary function is to facilitate the creation of microbial
signatures, which are essentially lists of microbes sharing specific taxonomy
ranks and attribute values. Once the data frames containing attribute
information are imported, the `makeSignatures` function can be employed to
generate these signatures. `makeSignatures` offers various filtering options,
including evidence, frequency, and minimum and maximum values for numeric
attributes. For more precise filtering requirements, users can leverage
standard data manipulation functions on the relevant data frame,
such as `dplyr::filter`.

Examples:

+ Create signatures of taxon names at the genus level for the aerophilicity
attribute (discrete):

```{r}
aer_sigs_g <- makeSignatures(
  dat = bp[["aerophilicity"]], tax_id_type = "Taxon_name", tax_level = "genus"
)
map(aer_sigs_g, head)
```

+ Create signatures of taxon names at the species level for the growth
temperature attribute (numeric):

```{r}
gt_sigs_sp <- makeSignatures(
  dat = bp[["growth temperature"]], tax_id_type = "Taxon_name",
  tax_level = 'species'
)
map(gt_sigs_sp, head)
```

+ Create signatures with a custom threshold for the growth temperature
attribute (numeric):

```{r}
gt_sigs_mix <- makeSignatures(
  dat = bp[["growth temperature"]], tax_id_type = "Taxon_name",
  tax_level = "mixed", min = 0, max = 25
)
map(gt_sigs_mix, head)
```

+ Create signatures for the animal pathogen attribute (boolean):

```{r}
ap_sigs_mix <- makeSignatures(
  dat = bp[["animal pathogen"]], tax_id_type = "NCBI_ID",
  tax_level = "mixed", evidence = c("exp", "igc", "nas", "tas")
)
map(ap_sigs_mix, head)
```

+ Create signatures for all of the bugphyzz data frames:

```{r}
sigs <- map(bp, makeSignatures) |> 
  list_flatten()
length(sigs)
```

```{r}
head(map(sigs, head))
```

# Run a bug set enrichment analysis

Bugphyzz signatures are suitable for conducting bug set enrichment analysis
using existing tools available in R. In this example, we will perform a set enrichment analysis using a dataset
with a known biological ground truth.

The dataset originates from the Human Microbiome Project (2012) and compares
subgingival and supragingival plaque.
This data will be imported using the [MicrobiomeBenchmarkData package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/MicrobiomeBenchmarkData.html).
For the implementation of the enrichment analysis, we will utilize the
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method available in the
[EnrichmentBrowser package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EnrichmentBrowser.html).
The expected outcome is an enrichment of aerobic taxa in the supragingival
plaque (positive enrichment score) and anaerobic taxa in the subgingival plaque
(negative enrichment score).


Load necessary packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(EnrichmentBrowser)
library(MicrobiomeBenchmarkData)
library(mia)
```

Import benchmark data:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dat_name <- 'HMP_2012_16S_gingival_V35'
tse <- getBenchmarkData(dat_name, dryrun = FALSE)[[1]]
tse_genus <- splitByRanks(tse)$genus
min_n_samples <- round(ncol(tse_genus) * 0.2)
tse_subset <- tse_genus[rowSums(assay(tse_genus) >= 1) >= min_n_samples,]
tse_subset
```

Perform differential abundance (DA) analysis to get sets of microbes:

```{r}
tse_subset$GROUP <- ifelse(
  tse_subset$body_subsite == 'subgingival_plaque', 0, 1
)
edger <- deAna(
    expr = tse_subset, de.method = 'edgeR', padj.method = 'fdr', 
    filter.by.expr = FALSE, 
)

dat <- data.frame(colData(edger))
design <- stats::model.matrix(~ GROUP, data = dat)
assay(edger) <- limma::voom(
  counts = assay(edger), design = design, plot = FALSE
)$E
```

Perform GSEA and display the results:

```{r, message=FALSE}
gsea <- sbea(
  method = 'gsea', se = edger, gs = aer_sigs_g, perm = 1000,
  alpha = 0.1 
)
gsea_tbl <- as.data.frame(gsea$res.tbl) |> 
  mutate(
    GENE.SET = ifelse(PVAL < 0.05, paste0(GENE.SET, ' *'), GENE.SET),
    PVAL = round(PVAL, 3),
  ) |> 
  dplyr::rename(BUG.SET = GENE.SET)
knitr::kable(gsea_tbl)
```

# Get signatures associated with a specific microbe

To retrieve all signature names associated with a specific taxon,
users can utilize the `getTaxonSignatures` function.
It's important to note that only taxids should be used as input for this
function.

Let's see an example using _Escherichia coli_ (taxid: 562).

Get taxid for _E. coli_ using taxize:

```{r, message=FALSE}
taxid <- as.character(taxize::get_uid("Escherichia coli"))
taxid
```

Get all signature names associated to the _E. coli_ taxid:

```{r}
getTaxonSignatures(tax = taxid, bp = bp)
```

# Session information:

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
