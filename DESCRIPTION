Description: bugphyzz is an electronic database of standardized microbial
  annotations. It facilitates the creation of microbial signatures based on
  shared attributes, which are utilized for bug set enrichment analysis. The
  data also includes annotations imputed with ancestra state
  reconstruction methods.
